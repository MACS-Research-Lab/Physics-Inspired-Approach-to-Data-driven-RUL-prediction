# Physics-Inspired-Approach-to-Data-driven-RUL-prediction
In engineering prognostics, predicting remaining useful life (RUL) is crucial. Traditional data-driven methods lack flexibility and explanability. Our work introduces a flexible, explainable model inspired by physics approach. It provides adjustable prediction conservatism without retraining the model.
